RULE 1: SOLID PRINCIPLES
Single Responsibility Principle: A class or function should have one, and only one, reason to change.
Open/Closed Principle: Code should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

RULE 2: BIG-O OPTIMIZATION
Bubble Sort (O(n^2)) should always be replaced with built-in sorting functions or efficient algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort (O(n log n)).
Nested loops searching for elements should be replaced with Hash Maps or Hash Sets to reduce lookup time from O(n) to O(1).

RULE 3: VARIABLE NAMING
Avoid single-letter variables like 'x', 'p', or 'temp' unless used as standard loop iterators (i, j, k).
Variables must be descriptive (e.g., 'passengerCount' instead of 'pc').

RULE 4: REDUNDANCY
Remove unused variables immediately.
Combine multiple identical loops if they iterate over the same data.
